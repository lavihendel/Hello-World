# Hello-World
Learning Branches and pulling requests
Now I find out that a main is incloud the whole code and without any other classes but the readme file.
I thought that branches are the same as extra classes. 
After I looked for a way of writing extra file (as the readme) and I found no way to do that, 
I tried to add a branch and didn't understand the reason it lookes the same as the main.
than I notice that the branch is just a copy of the main. 
 I realized that actually its a new version that may in the future to be the main version.
 All it needs is the agreement of the other programers.
